# SocraTeach

**SocraTeach** is an AI-powered learning platform designed to teach Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the Socratic method. By engaging students in guided question-based dialogue, SocraTeach encourages critical thinking and deeper understanding, allowing learners to grasp complex concepts through inquiry rather than memorization.

The core of the project is an AI-driven chatbot that interacts with students, asking thought-provoking questions, providing hints, and offering feedback in real-time. This adaptive learning experience is personalized to each student's responses, creating a flexible and engaging environment for mastering DSA topics.
