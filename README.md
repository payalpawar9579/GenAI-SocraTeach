Website Link:
**SocraTeach** is an AI-powered learning platform designed to teach Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the Socratic method. By engaging students in guided question-based dialogue, SocraTeach encourages critical thinking and deeper understanding, allowing learners to grasp complex concepts through inquiry rather than memorization.

The core of the project is an AI-driven chatbot that interacts with students, asking thought-provoking questions, providing hints, and offering feedback in real-time. This adaptive learning experience is personalized to each student's responses, creating a flexible and engaging environment for mastering DSA topics.

## Key Features
- **Socratic Teaching**: The AI uses the Socratic method to guide students by asking questions that stimulate deeper thought and exploration.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: The chatbot engages students in dynamic conversations, offering tailored hints and feedback based on their current understanding.
- **Personalized Learning**: Adaptable learning paths are designed to fit each student's pace and progress, ensuring individualized instruction.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If the chatbot fails to understand a query, it prompts the user to rephrase, keeping the learning flow uninterrupted.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using React and Tailwind CSS, SocraTeach ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience across devices.
